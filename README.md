Now-a-days the lifestyle of people is different. They feel uncomfortable and time consuming for going to crowded markets. 
So, E-Shopping is a boon as it saves lot of time. Online shopping is a process whereby consumers directly buy goods, services etc. from a seller without an intermediary service over the Internet. Shoppers can visit web stores from the comfort of their house and shop by sitting in front of their computers. Online stores are available at all times.
This project is a web-based shopping system. It's objective is to deliver an online shopping application.
